RFM Analysis
RFM analysis is a data-driven marketing technique used to segment customers based on their past behavior and interactions with a business. The acronym "RFM" stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, which are the three key metrics used to evaluate customer behavior:
Recency: How recently did the customer make a purchase? Customers who have made recent purchases are generally more engaged and valuable to the business than those who haven't interacted for a long time.
Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases? Customers with a higher frequency of purchases are likely to be more loyal and active.
Monetary Value: How much money does the customer spend? Customers who have spent more money are considered more valuable to the business.
